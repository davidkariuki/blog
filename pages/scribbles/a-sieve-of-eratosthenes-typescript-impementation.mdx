The [Sieve of Eratosthenes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sieve_of_Eratosthenes)
is an algorithm for finding all prime numbers between 2 (the smallest prime
number) and a given limit, n. It has a time complexity of O(n log log n). The
gist of the algorithm is to mark off all multiples of primes inside this range,
leaving only the prime numbers themselves.

### The Algorithm

For this example, let n = 10.

Step 1: Create a list of all numbers between 2 and n.

```typescript
[2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]
```

Step 2: Set p = 2.

Step 3: Mark off all multiples of 2 (excluding 2) until n leaving the following:

```typescript
[2, 3, 5, 7, 9]
```

Step 4: Assign the next smallest number that hasn't been marked in the previous
operation to p. Repeat from step 3.

In this case, the next p is 3. We can safely assume that number is prime.
Marking off multiples of 3, we are left with the following array:

```typescript
[2, 3, 5, 7]
```

Step 5: If there isn't any number left that hasn't been marked off, the
algorithm is done. The unmarked numbers are the primes between 2 and n,
inclusive. Our final output is:

```typescript
[2, 3, 5, 7]
```

### The Code

Here are a few test cases to check that our implementation does what it's
supposed to do. The test setup is Enzyme + Jest.

```typescript
import { sift } from "../../lib/sieve"

describe("Sieve of Eratosthenes", () => {
  test("sift(0) returns an empty array", () => {
    expect(sift(0)).toEqual([])
  })

  test("sift(2) returns [2]", () => {
    expect(sift(2)).toEqual([2])
  })

  test("sift(10) returns all primes less than 10", () => {
    expect(sift(10)).toEqual([2, 3, 5, 7])
  })

  test("sift(11) returns all primes between 2 and 11", () => {
    expect(sift(11)).toEqual([2, 3, 5, 7, 11])
  })
})
```

And finally, the implementation:

```typescript
interface PrimesHash {
  [index: number]: boolean
}

export const sift = (limit: number): number[] => {
  if (limit === 2) return [2]

  // Step 1: create an array from 2..limit inclusive
  let allNums: number[] = Array.from({ length: limit - 1 }, (_v, k) => k + 2)

  // Step 2: set p = smallest prime
  let p = 2

  // create a hash of { number: boolean }, from the array created in step 1,
  // setting every value to true
  let primes: PrimesHash = allNums.reduce((hash: PrimesHash, num: number) => {
    hash[num] = true
    return hash
  }, {})

  // Step 4: find the next smallest prime and repeat step 3
  while (p <= limit) {
    if (primes[p] === true) {
      // Step 3: mark off all multiples of p. We start from p*p as
      // an optimisation
      for (let i = p * p; i <= limit; i += p) {
        primes[i] = false
      }
    }
    p++
  }

  // Step 5: return all unmarked numbers
  return Object.keys(primes).reduce((array: number[], key) => {
    if (primes[+key] === true) {
      array.push(+key)
    }

    return array
  }, [])
}
```

This was a fun algorithm to implement 🎉.
