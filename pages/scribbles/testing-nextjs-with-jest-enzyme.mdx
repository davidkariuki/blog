Over the last few months, [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) has become my default framework for pet projects. I love that it integrates painlessly with TypeScript, and I found that setting up a testing framework was just as effortless.

## Getting started

Let's first create a Next.js app.

```bash
yarn create next-app next-typescript-enzyme-jest-example
```
Add development dependencies for the TypeScript conversion. With [ts-node](https://github.com/TypeStrong/ts-node) we can also write our config files in TypeScript. 

```bash
yarn add --dev typescript ts-node @types/react @types/node
```

Finally, we add a `tsconfig.json` file, which automatically gets populated when we start the Next.js server.

```bash
touch tsconfig.json
```
Okay! The project is ready to go, and all that's left is to convert any lingering JavaScript files by following [these instructions](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/typescript).

## Adding Jest & Enzyme

I chose [Jest](https://jestjs.io/) as my front-end testing framework because of familiarity (prior experience with [RSpec](https://rspec.info/)), and [Enzyme](https://enzymejs.github.io/enzyme/) for no particular reason whatsoever.

```bash
yarn add --dev jest ts-jest enzyme @wojtekmaj/enzyme-adapter-react-17 @types/jest @types/enzyme
```
I chose [ts-jest](https://kulshekhar.github.io/ts-jest/) over [@babel/preset-typescript](https://babeljs.io/docs/en/babel-preset-typescript) because [I was told it has better type-checking](https://kulshekhar.github.io/ts-jest/docs/babel7-or-ts/). Also, [@wojtekmaj's](https://github.com/wojtekmaj) fork of enzyme adapter is only a [temporary stopgap](https://github.com/enzymejs/enzyme/issues/2429#issuecomment-679265564) until the official adapter supports React 17.

Now that we have installed the testing dependencies, we'll create a couple of config files for Jest:

```typescript
// jest.config.ts
import type { Config } from "@jest/types"

const config: Config.InitialOptions = {
  verbose: true,
  preset: "ts-jest",
  testEnvironment: "node",
}

export default config
```
and Enzyme:

```typescript
// enzyme.config.ts
import { configure } from "enzyme"
import Adapter from "@wojtekmaj/enzyme-adapter-react-17"

configure({ adapter: new Adapter() })
```
That's it! We are now ready to write unit and integration tests. Below is how I have my scripts set up:

```json
  "scripts": {
    ...
    "test": "jest",
    "test:watch": "jest --watchAll",
    "test:coverage": "jest --coverage"
  },
```
