When I started this blog in 2014, I was still a fresh developer, riding the Ruby
on Rails high and enjoying every bit of it. I was on an unstoppable quest to
gain knowledge and share it in the form of a tech blog. However, just after five
posts, I ran face-first into a wall. Clearly, my motivation wasn't as infallible
as I thought it was.

### Early Beginnings

Writing has always been a passion of mine, so it should not have been hard to
stay on the task. I started writing when I was very young. First with short
stories, and then later poetry. I had a small group of friends in secondary
school who liked to read my fiction. During my university years, one of my
favourite weekend activities was to make camp in coffee shops, writing. I was a
frequent patron at Starbucks and Panera Bread all over Manhattan and in Hoboken.
I wrote a lot. In 2008, one of my poems got published by a collegiate literary
anthology.

### So why did I stop writing

As I gained knowledge, I realised how much I didn't know, and it was
considerably disheartening. Perhaps it was a bit of impostor syndrome. Writing
started to feel like a chore -- it evoked unpleasant memories of writing
research papers in university. I wanted the freedom of creative writing but
didn't know how to do that with a tech blog. Eventually, I relented to the
pressure and found ways to make myself too busy to write.

### Reviving My Blog

An idea that encouraged me to reboot the word fountain was to stop limiting
myself to writing about tech. If I can write about anything, then my canvas is
infinite.

Octopress, which was the static site generator that I had used, had become
abandonware. I resolved not to spend too much time musing on which platform
would be a suitable host for my blog. I just happened to be interested in
learning Next.js and polishing up my TypeScript, so that became my choice.
Transitioning from Octopress was easy because I didn't have a lot of posts, and
the existing ones were simple Markdown files.

### Future Plans

I don't have a concrete plan, other than to continue writing. I released the
site in an incomplete state because I didn't want the process of building it to
become a hindrance. Consequently, there are some improvements that I want to
implement, including:

- ~~Moving from plain Markdown to MDX.~~
- ~~Adding a way to navigate my travelogue chronologically.~~
- Writing tests with Jest.
- Theming my site to add light mode.
- Rewriting navigation for mobile devices.
- Adding an RSS feed, is this still a thing in 2020?
- Implementing pagination.
